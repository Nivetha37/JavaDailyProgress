/*Chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym. 
  The monthly cost of the gym is X and personal training will cost him an additional Y per month.
  Chef's total budget per month is only Z. 
         -Print 1 if Chef can only join the gym.
         -Print 2 if he can also have a personal trainer.
         -Print 0 if he can't even join the gym.

Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer, he must join the gym â€” he cannot hire the trainer without joining the gym.*/
